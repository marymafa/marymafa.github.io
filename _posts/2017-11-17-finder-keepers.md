### Finders Keepers

I were asked to create a function that looks through an array (first argument) and returns the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument).


### My Approach

### method 1

I created a function title find element and passes the parameters
named  arr and func.  

### method 2

I have created  a for loop that will iterate though the each 
arguments. On the test statement i said  if func(arr[i] is true
then return arra[i] meaning that it checks if the  result on the 
function are true or not then return  and if is true should return 
the element of an that will pass through the argument.

### method 3

I created another function that will return number in an array that are 
 divisible by two and leaves a remainder which is zero.


Finally , i tested the test it was working and it returned  eight and undefined 
following the instructions.
