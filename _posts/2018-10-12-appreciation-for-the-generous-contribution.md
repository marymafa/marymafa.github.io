### Appreciation for the generous contribution
First of all, I would like to express great appreciation for the generous contribution to help further my education.Your help has provided me with hope and courage to live a better life. I have improved on learning new things, with your help am able to use bitbucket and is a great tool for productive collaborative coding. And also my machine was not faster so we bought another hard drive to back up my machine and now am able to do my projects and is faster than the previous one.

Now I have an access to FreeCodeCamp where I can learn, understand the basics of coding and Solve coding challenges so that I can build good products for the clients.  I like the way they introduced react and redux like I didn't know how the syntax of redux works but through FreeCodeCamp am able to build products using react and redux. I look forward to a continued relationship with you.
