### API

getInitialState

Implement the function getInitialState, which returns... the initial state of the component. This is an object map of keys to value.


this.state

To access a component's state, use this.state, just like how we use this.props.

this.setState

To update a component's state, call this.setState with an object map of keys to updated values. Keys that are not provided are not affected. When a component's state changes, render is called with the new state and the UI is updated to the new output. This is the heart of React. 

### The new context API consists of three main parts:

1. React.createContext which is passed the initial value (and optionally a fancy opt-out function that uses a bitmask). This returns an object with a Provider and a Consumer.

2. The Provider component is used higher in the tree and accepts a prop called value (which can be anything).

3.  The Consumer component is used anywhere below the provider in the tree and accepts a prop called “children” which must be a function that accepts the value and must return a react element (JSX).
