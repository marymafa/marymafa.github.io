###  EventListener

### addEventListener

*Irt allows  adding more than a single handler for an event.

*It gives you finer-grained control of the phase when the listener  is atracted (capturing vs bubbling).

*It works  on any Dom element.


### Adding a listener during event  dispitch.

*If an EventListener is added to an  event  Target while It is processing an event ,that event  does no ttrigger the listener.

### Multiple identical event  listener.

*If multiple EventListener are registed  on the same event Target with the same parameters,the  duplicate intances  are discarded.
