### Tic Tac Toe project

Last i didn't finish my tic tac toe game because i did html and css only. I want to continue with my project following the user stories , for me to fulfill the user stories i should also include javascript. 

### Javascript

I created there variable called playchoice for the user to choose whether to be character X or character O, another variable is called computerchoice like also the computer will choose to play as caharacter X or character O and teh last variable is calledd computer player like if is player one  only then thqat player wil paly with the computer. Each variable will store it's own data.
