###  Twitter

Is a free social messaging service for sending and receiving  short messages in real time.

People use  Twitter to  learn about topics theycare about and to share their thoughts with other people--in other words, to both send and receive messages.The connecting is simmilar to facebook, only  on Twitter the people who connect with you are called "followers" instead of "friends".Business of all kinds also  use Twitter to market their products and services  and  government officials also send many tweets,which  often are quored  in the media  as sources of news.

If people  can't browser youre tweets because they're private,fewer people will be able to follow you and Twitter is all about people "following" or text-talking to other people.
