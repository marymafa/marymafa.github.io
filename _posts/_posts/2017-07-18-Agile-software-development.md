### Agile Software development
Programmers were trained by engineers.
That training dictated how they apporoched software development.
Bulding  software development is like creating a work art,it requires  creativity in design
software development remains malleable.
The biggest problem  with  software dedelopment is changing requirement.
There are  domains where requirement canâ€™t change,but most project have changing requirement.
Programmers must assume that they know everything,when asking  questions it diffucult or slow  the knowledge  gap grows.

### METHODOLOGy

These methods impose a displiciplined process upon software development with aim of making software development more predictable and more efficient.
Engineers work on a series of drawings  that pricisely   indicate  what need  to be buid and how these things need to be put together
software development|: construction is so cheap  as to be free.
In the software all the effort is design,and thus requires creative and talented people.
Have a goog plan  before you create an software development like engineers  before they build a house,bridge whatever they plan first.
The software  is written without much underlying plan ,when system grows it difficult to addc new feartures.

### Fundermental different activities:
-Design: Which is difficult to predict.
-construction : which is esier to predict.
Whemn you have the design ,  then you can p[lan for constraction.
