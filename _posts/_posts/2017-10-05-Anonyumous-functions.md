### Anonyumous functions
Is a function that is not stored in a program file,but is associated with a vqariable whose data type is fuction_handle.

Can accept and return output,just as standard functions do.

There are called anonymous because theey aren,t given a name in the same way as normal functions.

They are most useful as the value of callback parameters,but tghey have many others.
