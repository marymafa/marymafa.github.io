###  Wikipedia Viewer
Allows users to search for a certain keyword snd returns a list of related  wikipedia articles. Users can see a random wikipedia article by cliking the button "random".

### user stories:

1.As a user, I can click  a button to see  a random  wikipedia entry.

2.As a user, I can search Wikipedia  entries in a search box and see resulting  Wikipedia entries.

### Rules:
1.Full fill the user stories.

2.Use whichever  libraries  or Api you need.

I decided to have a button for input text and for search  box, like if you are searching something you just click the search box ,then after you click description for whatever article you  have searched for and it will take you directly to the wikipedia. And, a button for random if you want to see a random wikipedia  entry.

On this project i have learned how to build a wikipedia view that will allow users to search any articles they want.
