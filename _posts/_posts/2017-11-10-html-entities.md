### Convert HTML Entities

 About HTML ENTITIES

An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;) .  Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). 


### Intructions:

Convert the characters &, <, >, " (double quote), and ' (apostrophe), in a string to their corresponding HTML entities.


### Problem started

When my switch statement returns wrong results. But i did my best to make sure that it will execute good results.

### Solution

And  this is how it works:

1.The switch expression is evaluated once.

2.The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.

3.If there is a match, the associated block of code is execute
