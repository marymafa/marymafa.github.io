### Refactoring

Is when changing the structure of programming so that the function is not changed.

Also it is used to improve the design of an existing code base.

### If we are making a refacatoring  or behavior-preserving codemodification:

*we do not expect new behaviour 

*we expect cleaner code when we are done.

*all our unit tests should pass before and after the modification.

### If we are making a behaviour-changing code modification:

*We expect new behavoiur.

*we should write new tests.

*we may get dirtier code when we are done.
