Simon Game 

Is a simple game which goal is for user to repeat the pattern showed by the program. With each round a new step is added to the pattern making, the game much more difficult with every round. Additionally, the program should play a different sound for each field that is activated. On top Of that you have to enable user to switch between strict mode, which restarts a game whenever user selects wrong field in a pattern, and normal mode which only repeats the pattern subsequent of the wrong button being pressed. The provided example constituted of 4 different fields with different color for each field and I followed with the same idea. I genuinely did like the design Free Code Camp example so I decided to look at it and then buil my own simon game following  the user stories.

HTML and CSS

As usual, I used Bootstrap for responsiveness of the game, and added my own styles using CSS. Next I create a div for each of the game buttons there are 4 in total and named them accordingly.
Each div has its own class, id and value.I also added a Settings button to activate Bootstrap modal in which buttons for resetting the game are stored.When it comes to CSS I had a problem with showing which of the elements are in a pattern. 


Javascript

The first thing I did was creating an JavaScript  variable called colors that contains those four colors, another variable called possibleColors need an array to store playerâ€™s input,and the last variable is
player that will store user's input.
