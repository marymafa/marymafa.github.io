### Random quotes machine
Allow  users to get new quote if they click the buton.

### Instructions:
-We were instructed to build a random quotes machine same as the given example at free code camp.
<<<<<<< HEAD
-If  the user click a buuton  it is going to show  user a new quotes.
-If the user press a button it is going to tweet out a quote.

Firstly i spent minutes trying to understand the project. I forced myself to know what am  building and how will my quote  look like or be. After i made sure that my quotes works following the instructions. And  i  tested my code  to see if user click a button it will show quote and it was working. And went through design thinking to perform creativity in design.

### I decided to :
-create a button for new quotes,
-and also for tweeter
-Use math.floor and math.random to make sure that when user click  a button for new quotes 
should show new quotes.

On the given project i didn't  struggle that much because i used pure javascript and html
only.I have learned that you should understand  the problem first,and think on how you wiil
solve it and it will be much easy.
