### Random quotes machine
Allow  users to get new quote if they click the buton.

### Instructions:
-We were instructed to build a random quotes machine same as the given example at free code camp.

-If  the user click a button  it is going to show  user a new quote.

-If the user press a button it is going to tweet out a quote.

Firstly, I spent minutes trying to understand the project. I forced myself to know what am i building and how will my project  look like or be. I made sure that my quotes works by following the instructions. I  tested my code  to see if the user click a button can  show quote, and it was working. I implimented design thinking technic.

### I decided to :
-create a button for new quotes,  and also for tweeter.

-Use math.floor and math.random to make sure that when the user click  a button for new quotes should show new quotes.

On the given project i didn't  struggle that much because i used pure javascript and html
only.I have learned that you should understand  the problem first,and think on how you are you going to solve it ,and it will be much easy.
