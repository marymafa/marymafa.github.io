### Pomodoro Clock

On this project i were suppose to build a pomodoro clock that is simmilar to freecodecamp  following the users stories, Like the user can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed,  can reset the clock for my next pomodoro and  can reset the clock for my next pomodoro. 

### code explanation:

1.I should Use whichever libraries or APIs i need.

2. Should give it my own personal style.

### My Approach

I created buttons for play if it's stopped,  and the second one is the reset  button if the user wanna reset the time and the last one is pause button.  Each button has it's own id and class and div. I also created another div  class named jumbotron for message and time . This jumbotron is a container shape.

I used document  dot ready function  for the page to be manupulated , Inside it i have three variable that will do their own part.

I created a function titled check status , it is used to check the status like if is not  working click the start button , then the user user can pause it using  pause button or can reset it using reset button . If it's working , the user can click pause botton, or reset button and so on. 

I created another function titled show time ,  When the user click start button it will show time and it will count-down. I created two variable, the first variable called min(minutes) and on it i used math dot floor to round a number downdards to the nearest integer.

For today i managed to do those things and i will continue tommorrow for my pomodoro to work well. It was challenging but in a good way .sd
