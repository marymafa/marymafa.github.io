###My observation for last week

I observed that  clients  connect to the  proxy server,requesting some  services ,such as  file,webpage,connection and so on.

It simplify and  control complexity.

Open proxy-ussers to  conceal thier IP adress.

Also i observed that jquery is a fast,small and feature-rich javascript library,and it makes html to be much simpler.

Html use  cascading stylesheet and jquey use script instead of style,should have an open,close script and dollar($).

Jquery has changed  the way  millions  of people write javascript.javascript  start with two-forward slash// e.g //Dedfine my Name below this line.
