### The debugging process

-In software development, debugging involves locating and correcting code errors in a computer program.

-Debugging is part of the software testing process and is an integral part of the entire software development lifecycle. 

- In a large program that has thousands and thousands of lines of code, 

-the debugging process can be made easier by using strategies such as unit tests, code reviews and pair programming.

-Once an error has been identified, it is necessary to actually find the error in the code.

- At this point, it can be useful to look at the code's logging and use a stand-alone debugger tool or 

-the debugging component of an integrated development environment (IDE). 

-The debugging component of an IDE typically provides the programmer with the capability to view memory and see variables, run the program to the next breakpoint, 

-execute just the next line of code, and, in some cases, change the value of variables or 

-even change the contents of the line of code about to be executed.

-Source code analyzers, which include security, common code errors and complexity analyzers, can also be helpful in debugging.
