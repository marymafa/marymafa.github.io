### Drop it

1. I were asked to drop the elements of an array (first argument), 		starting from the front, until the predicate (second argument) 		returns true.

2. The second argument, func, is a function you'll use to test the 		first elements of the array to decide if you should drop it or 		not.

Return the rest of the array, otherwise return an empty array.

### code explanation

1. Create a while loop to check each element.

2. Or reate a for loop to check each element.

3. Then check for the function given if true then stop, otherwise 		remove that element.

4. return the array.
