		### My observation of last week

In imposter syndrome  i observed  that human where overwoking in perfectionalism because of fear of failure.

They doubt that their own abbilities were not allowed them to be hired.

Also they think that their abilities  may be rejected.

In shuhari i observed that we pass through shuhari e.g  we obey,move away from main subject and separate.

In design thinking  i observed that  your design should be creative so that you find solution for clients
add you shoul define and ideate your problems so that  can be solved.

In paradigms i observed that  fuction programming based on fuction  and elements of computer programs 
also objective -orientated programming based objects not fuctions and  procedures.
