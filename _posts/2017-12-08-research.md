Delegating events 

Like refresh elements , well have deleate function that will be called when the controller is nstantiates.
 This will parse the controller's events object , attaching event callbacks.

State machines

States machine consists of two things: states and transitions.  It has only one active state, but  it has only a multitude of passive states . 
When the active states switches, transitions between the states are called.

Using the URL hash


setting the hash  tag too often  can really hurt  performance  especially on mobile browers.
So if you are  setting it requently-say as a user scrolls through a list-you  may want to consider throttling.

Dectrecting hash changes

When the hash change event firew, we can make sure the application is in the appropriatte states. The event has good cross browser support with implementations in all the latest version of the major  browser, chrome etc.
