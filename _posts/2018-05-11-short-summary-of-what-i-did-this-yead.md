### What I have learnt and built

### So far with javascript i have built:

1. simon game where the user can presented with a random series of button presses, Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, 
user can  see the same series of button presses but with an additional step, 
can hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when 
the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button and so on.

2. tic tac toe where the user can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer, 
reset as soon as it's over so I can play again and  
can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

3. Pomodoro Clock where the user can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed,
 can reset the clock for my next pomodoro and customize the length of each pomodoro.

4. calculator where the user I can add, subtract, multiply and
 divide two numbers , can clear the input field with a clear button and 
 can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button,
  and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

### with react i have built

1. Markdown Previewer where the user can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a 
   text area can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

2. Camper Leaderboard where the user  can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers 
who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days,  
can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and
 how many they've earned total,  can toggle between sorting the list by how many
  brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.

3. Build a Recipe Box where the user can click into any of those recipes to view it, 
can edit these recipes,  can delete these recipes, 
All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage.
 If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

 ### Hobbies:

 Reading: helps to see different sides to situations and some of it is relatable  and
I learn something new.

writing: enables me to discover things about myself that I never knew.
