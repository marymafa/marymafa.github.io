### pomodoro clock

I want to continue with my project and following the user stories and i have faith that it's going to work. 

### My approach: 

I added another function titled pause that works with resume , like when you pause it then you can click the resume button to continue but if you click start it will start again from the beginning.

I added a reset function like when you click reset button it will clear the time interval and the user can click the start buutton to start again.

I also added the last function that will play sound the user click start button and the sound is bell.

Finnaly, i finished my project what remaining is to fix my css and resume function and beside that it's working and when the user clicks start it will start countdown and when the user clicks pause then it will be paused and lastly when the user clicks reset button and the it will clear the interval.s
