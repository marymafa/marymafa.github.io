		paradigms
is a pattern of something
criticism
they arque that many programming  language cannot be classified into one 
paradigm samaries
			
			multi-paradigm
Concurrent programming -these my involve multi-threading support for ` distributed computing ,message passing,shared or  futruere
Actor programming-concurrent computation with actors that make local  decision in respose to  the environment
constrain programming-relation between  variables  are expressed as constrains,directinng allowable solution
dataflow programing-forced recalculation of formulus when data values changeedg spreedsheet
Declarative programming-describe actions eg html describes a page
Fuction programming- evaluation of mathematical futions and avoids stat and mutable data
Distrubuted programming-have support for   multiple dutonomous computers that communicate via computer networks  
Genetic programmming-uses algorithms written in terms of to-bep-specified later types that are then instaintiated as needed for specific types provided as parameters
Imperative programming-explicit  statements that change a program state
Logic programming -uses explict mathematical logic for programming
metaprogramming-writting programming method that write or manipulate other programs as their data
 Template metaprogramming-metaprogramming methods in which template are used by a conpiler to generate temporary source code which merged by complier with rest of the source code and then  compier
Reflective programming-metaprogramming methods  program modifies or extends itself
 Objective-orientated-use data  structures  consisting of datafield and methods together  with their interaction to design programming  
Classes-based-object  programming-thhe inheritance is achieved by defining classes of objects results 
prototype based-object proggramming-orientated programming that  avoid classes and implements inheritance  via cloning instences
 Pipeline programming-a simple syntax change to add nrest fuctionals language originally designed with none
Rule-based programming-a network of rules of thumb that comprise a knowledge base and can be used for expert systerm
Visual programming-manipulating program element graphically than by specifying thm texttually
