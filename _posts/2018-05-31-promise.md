### Promise 

Is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. The promise can only be fulfilled or rejected once. 

A promise itself has one of the following three states:

1. Pending - until a promise is fulfilled it is inpending states.

2. Fulfilled- When the first handler is called promise is considered fulfilled with the value passed to that handler.

3. Rejected- if the handlers is called the promise is considered rejectednwith the value passed to that handler.

The handler can be attached to the promise using .then() method. This function or method takes a function tha will be passed the resolved value of the promise once it is fulfilled. the resolve calls the future promise when its ready and return it. the reject can reject th erpomise when it can't resolve the future promise. The await operation is used to wait for a promise , it can only be used inside an async function.
