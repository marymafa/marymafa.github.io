### CodeFest Experience

It was such a great experience and the event focused on IT solutions as part of the already world-class FNB innovators programme. Participants were judged on criteria of excellent, usefulness, usability, collaboration and relevance after building the solutions during 48 hours in teams of seven.

The product owner came where we were seated and explained what he wants us to build for him.  He made us understands the problem using Citizen app so that we may come up with the solution for the app. Like in  Citizen app we have Sync and Citizen Tv, In Sync we find articles and you can Like, Comment,share and tag the person, and in CItizen Tv you can watch videos, like, comment and share the video.In Citizen app After watching videos you have to go back  then go to the articles, So the problem was to bring both Sync and Citizen Tv together.

Agile Coaches helped us to have a clear understanding of the problem and also to be aware of the problems, needs, and options of the solution.  They gave us support to explore our mindsets, behaviors and the consequences to promote changes and improvements. Our strategies were well planned,they made us realize what is needed and what is not needed in the project.

Working as a team was a great idea because we managed to finish some of the stuff in 48 hours, we had something to present to the judges and they were impressed even though we didn't get the price but i had a great time.
