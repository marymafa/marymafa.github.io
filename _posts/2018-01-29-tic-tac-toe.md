### Building a Tic Tac Toe

In this project I,m soppose to  build atic tac toe game  , that can allow the user to play with  the computer if the user choose one player . Also creat a reset button  to allow the user to reset as soon as it's over so the user can play again and that will allow the user to choose whether to play as X or O.

### My Approach

HTML

I have an p(paragraph) element that will ask the user how do the user want to play  and i also  have two button for the user to choose whether to play as one  player or two player. 


I have another p element that will ask the if the user would like to be character X or character O, then the user will choose. I created a table with an id called tic tac and my table consists of tr wihch will define a row in a table and I also have td which will  define a cell in a table. I have another button for reset , like th euser cliks reset button it will clear as soon as the game is over so that th user can play again.

CSS

I used css to describe  how my TML page should be display (like to change th look on the entire page) because it needs creativity in design.

For a day i managed to do html page and css because i should do this project step by step to see where the problem is or am doing the right thing.
