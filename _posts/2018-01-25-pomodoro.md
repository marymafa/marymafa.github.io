### Building a Pomodoro clock

Last I did not finish this project, I was asked to build a Pomodoro clock that will allow the user to start a 25-minute Pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed, reset the clock for my next Pomodoro and customize the length of each Pomodoro.


### My Approach

Now want to continue with my javascript because am done with html what remains is to carry on with my javascript. Last time on my javascript i created check status  function, show time function and now i added start timer.

I have a starter timer when the user press start button the it will start counting from the 25 downward until the braeak point which is 5, then it will stop there. I also managed to do start time function and start function and i struggled to to do those things but went though internet and google some usefull stuff that will help me to finish my project.
