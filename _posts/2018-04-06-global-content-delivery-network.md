###  Global Content Delivery Network

is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability and high performance.


### Setting up Our Data Centers to Scale

Cloudflare deploys smaller footprints in more locations. This allows us to take advantage of innovative deployment, power, and cooling strategies. As a result, you have been able to optimize the processing of high volumes of traffic through our network.

By default, Cloudflare only caches static files. However, Page Rules can be utilized to set more files as cacheable. With Enterprise features like Query String Sort, Cloudflare will first sort the query strings in a URL into a deterministic order before checking cache for the resource or requesting it from the origin. This feature is especially useful for API servers, which often rely heavily on multiple query string arguments.


### How Can Cloudflare Offer a Free Service?

Cloudflare believes that anything connected to the Internet should be fast. Because of Cloudflare’s technology, you been able to build a CDN that is available to any website online.

From the beginning, you  worked to minimize the costs of serving every byte. Wherever possible, you use your own custom-built systems that are designed for this purpose. you buy your bandwidth through the wholesale market, which means you’re paying for the size of our pipe, not for each byte you serve through it.

you also peer with other networks wherever possible in order to drive the cost of bandwidth as close to zero as possible. you never charge for bandwidth and are committed to always offering a Free version of Cloudflare with at least today’s feature set. Cloudflare’s premium plans offer even better services at reasonable prices. We hope you love the service and choose to upgrade.
