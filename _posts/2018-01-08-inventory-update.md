### Inventory Update

Algorithem challenge:

I were asked to compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

### Code explanation: 

Create a new array that will will store the results after concating  array one and array two.
Have areduce methode that will will add array and array  two if both array have the same item.

### Problem started :

I  used for each statement to compare each element of the first array and the the second array and if there are the same element like 2 Hair pin and  3hair then it suppose to add those elements like it should be 5 hair pin instead of 2 hair pin and  3 hair pin in the same array but my code didn't add those elements.

###  My Approach :
I created a function title  update inventory that will merge array one and array two  into a single unit. I also created two variables the first one called current  inventory that stores current elements and the last one  called  new inventory that stores new elements.

### Conclusion:

I managed to merge two array and it was working  but it diidn't add two items if they are the same  and at least it return something.
