I did enjoy for playing around html and i spent five minutes or more dealing  with the problem.

It doesn’t matter how fast or slow i am,what really matters is that do i understand what i’m doing.

What surprised me is that i spent more minutes dealing with cascanding style sheet  and it was really challenging but  nowi know  how to handle it.

Also we reviewed our codes ,correcting each other, because it requires creativity in design


I have solved my problem  and discovered new opportunities on how to create a web page, now my web page  is attractive and i have saw my mistakes because it requires focus and thinking.
