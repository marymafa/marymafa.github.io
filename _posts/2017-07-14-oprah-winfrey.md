Oprah winfrey(the big secret in life)
The big secret is  that there is no big secret
Use every opportunity you get in life
You can’t achieve your goal unless you are willing to be  to be honest with yourself
There is no back doors or no free rides
Things that will make you to prosper 
Patient
Faith
focus
Is not to get what you want,fight until you get it
Wakeup an strengthen what you have before it dies completely
The battle of our life not stop until you fulfill your goals
Don’t read success stories you will get message but read failure stories you will have ideas to get success
Everybody has 24 hours no extra hours,those who are successful they had time to focus on their life…to be honest with themselves.
