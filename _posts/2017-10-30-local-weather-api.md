### Local Weather Api:

Allow you to acess current weather condition and reliable forecast before you  make plan because  weather can change anytime. Local Weather Api returns  weather elements such as temperature, precipitation,presure etc.



### User stories:

1.As a user, I can  se weather in my current location.

2.As a user, I can see different  icon or background  image.

3.As a user, I can push a button to goggle between Fahrenheit and Celcius.
 

### Rules:

1.Do no,t  look at the example Project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

2.Use whichever libraries or Apis you need.

3.Give it to your  personal style.

my understanding:

I should have a button for  Fahrenheit and Celcius and  for location  so that the users can  check weather where ever they are.  Also, I should have background images for weather.  It is important to follow instructions to  know what you are  doing and i used api to specify  how weather  show interact.  It shoud allow users the weather for today to see if it is going to be hot ,cold etc.


on this project  i could improve on building weather api because this days like almost everyday people check before they make plan because  weather can change anytime.
