### State and properties

State like React props are used to store data in React. A difference between state and props is that while the data stored by props are fixed throughout their lifetime, state store data that can be changed overtime. This change can be in response to user actions, network responses or anything. Also, while props are set by the parent component, state is changed internally by the component .You can set a component's default state, access the current state and update this state.
