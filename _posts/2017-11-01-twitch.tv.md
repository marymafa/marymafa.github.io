### Twitchtv json Api

IS the world leading video platform and community for gamers. And also, the site primarily focuses on video game live streaming.

### rule:

Fullfill the user stories.

### User stories: 

1.As a user, I can see weathe  freecodecamp is currently streaming  on Twitch.tv.

2.As a user,  I can click the status  output  and be sent  directly to the freecodecamp's twitch.tv.

3.As auser, If  a Twitch  user is currently  streaming, I can see adiditional details about  what tjey are streaming.

I decided to have a button that will allow the user to check weather the freecodecam is offline or online, If is online it will show
type of streaming and the viewrs. And if streamer is offline it will show offline only.


Streaming video is content sent in compressed form over the Internet and displayed by the viewer in real time. With streaming video or streaming media, a Web user does not have to wait to download a file to play it. Instead, the media is sent in a continuous stream of data and is played as it arrives.

On this project i have learned that it is possible to build  a  Twitch.tv that will will show streamers and their live streaming.
