### User stories: 

1.As a user, I can see weathe  freecodecamp is currently streaming  on Twitch.tv.

2.As a user,  I can click the status  output  and be sent  directly to the freecodecamp's twitch.tv.

3.As auser, If  a Twitch  user is currently  streaming, I can see adiditional details about  what tjey are streaming.

I decided to have a button that will allow the user to check weather the freecodecam is offline or online, If is online it will show
tye of streaming and the viewrs. And if streamer is offline it will show offline only.
