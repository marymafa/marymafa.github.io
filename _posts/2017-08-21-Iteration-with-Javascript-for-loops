### Iterate with javascript for loops

1-The initialization statement:

-is executed one time only before the loop starts.

-It is typucal used to define and setup your loop variable.



2-Condition statement:

-Is evaluated  at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long i t evaluates to true.

-When condition false  at the  start  of the iteration,the loop will stop executing.

-This means  if condition starts as false,your loop will never execute.

-Is executed at the end of each loop iteration,

-prior to the next conditon check and

- is ussualy used to increment or decrement your loop counter.
