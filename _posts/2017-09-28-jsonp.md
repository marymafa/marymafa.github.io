### JsonP[json with Padding]

-Is a  method for sending  json data without worrying about cross -domain issues.


-Jsonp does not use  the xmlhttprequets object to  avoid problems,

-because if you are requisting file from anothe domain  can problems, due to cross-domain policy.

-Json uses the script tag because when  requesting  an external script from another domain does not have this problem.


### Cross-domain


-Transfere of information between two or more differing  security domains.
