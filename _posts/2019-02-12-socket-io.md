###  Socket.IO 
Is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of:

* a Node.js server: Source | API
* a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js): Source | API

### Reliability
Connections are established even in the presence of:

* proxies and load balancers.

* personal firewall and antivirus software.

* For this purpose, it relies on Engine.IO, which first establishes a long-polling connection, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are “tested” on the side, like WebSocket. Please see the Goals * section for more information.

### example

io.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.emit('request', /* */); // emit an event to the socket
  io.emit('broadcast', /* */); // emit an event to all connected sockets
  socket.on('reply', function(){ /* */ }); // listen to the event
});
