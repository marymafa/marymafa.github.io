 DNA pairing

This exercises was interesting, i did not spend much time on it and it was easier.

### Instructions

We were supposse to return the provided character as the first element in each array for example input  GCG and return [["G","C"]["C","G"]["G","C"]]


 Solution

I decide to create a variable called pair and str were it is going to split DNA strand. And also, includede for loop were strand will iterated there. My testing statement is used to test DNA strand like if is A it should  push pair and return "T","A" or if is T it should push pair and return "a","T". And if is G it will return "C,"G" or it will return "G","C" if is C. I consoled to see whether am i going to get an accurate result.



I have learned that it is simple to solve an exercise only if you understand the problem and you realy know how am i going to this and it was not challenging.
