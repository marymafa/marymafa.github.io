### dispatch(action)​

Dispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.
The store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously.
Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and
the change listeners will immediately be notified.

### Action (Object†):
A plain object describing the change that makes sense for your application.
Actions are the only way to get data into the store, so any data, whether from the UI events,
network callbacks, or other sources such as WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions. Actions must have a type field that indicates the type of action being performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another module. It's better to use strings for type than Symbols because strings are serializable.
