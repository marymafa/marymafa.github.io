###  Sum all Primes

We are asked to find the sum of the prime number up to and including the provided number.

About Prime:


A prime number is defined as a number greather than one and having
only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible  by one and two.


### My Approach

Method 1

I have created the second  function called primeNumbers that will  check to see if number we pass in is a prime number  or not. 
If is a prime number should return true.


Method 2

I have included an if statement that if is prime numbers , should
push it to a variable called array of prime and after pushing then 
return the sum of primes.

Finally, both functions will execute the sum of the prime numbers 
and check whether the numbers are prime numbers or not.
