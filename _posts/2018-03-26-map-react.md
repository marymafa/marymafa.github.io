### Map-in-react

map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it.

### There are quite a few parentheses in there thanks to the way map() works

1. For every item in the array, it gives us the item itself in person and the position of the item in index.

2. It creates a new anonymous function (that's the => part) that receives those two things as a parameter and will return a value of the modified data.

3. It uses the input element to create some JSX based on the person.


 if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to extract a component.
