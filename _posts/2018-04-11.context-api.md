### Context API

Context provides a way to share values like this between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. Context provides a way to share values like this between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.


The Consumer component is used anywhere below the provider in the tree and accepts a prop called “children” which must be a function that accepts the value and must return a react element (JSX). The Provider component is used higher in the tree and accepts a prop called value (which can be anything).

### When to Use Context

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language

### The new context API consists of three main parts:

 * React.createContext which is passed the initial value (and optionally a fancy opt-out function that uses a bitmask). This returns an object with a Provider and a Consumer

 * The Provider component is used higher in the tree and accepts a prop called value (which can be anything).

  * The Consumer component is used anywhere below the provider in the tree and accepts a prop called “children” which must be a function that accepts the value and must return a react element (JSX).
