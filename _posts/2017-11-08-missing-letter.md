This exercise was the most challenging one and i spent much time on it , trying to figure out how am i going to solve it and it made me to 
thin more and come up with another ideas.


### Instructions:

Find the missing letter in the passed leteer range  and return it

### My Approach 

In the given function i decided to the create a variable called first which is equal to string.chartCodeAt index zero, I diid that to compare it to the charactercode at the same position. On my test statement i said if string.charCodeAt(i) is not equal to first index meaning that
the missing letter is is the one next in the sequence and equal  to first . Then it returned  the correct letter using str.fromCharCode(first).
If  there are the same , the expected letter in the corrrect position  and  all it need to do is to increase first by 1.



### Problem started:
when it was not returning the missing letter, like it was returning the whole  array and i kept on trying and by checking  my if statement, like if  the test statement  is wrong then it wiil return wrong result.

I decided to use difference method so that i get the correct result. I enjoyed  it even though i it was challenging and am execited  because 
because at last it returned the missing letter.
